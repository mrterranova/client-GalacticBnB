# client-GalacticBnB
This project is based off of popular Bed and Breakfast online applications and an extension on EarthBnB. This application has all major components for being able to view a particular location, popular sites surrounding that location, viewing amenities, rooms available and more. The extension includes a search that operates between client and AWS elastic search

## Technology
  * Server: Java/Springboot
  * Client: AngularJS
  * Database: MySQL
  
## Personal Contributions
  * Routing between components
  * Client installation of AWS ElasticSearch
  * Other Popular Destinations on Results Page
  
## Installation
Fork the repo and clone to local drive. You will need an AWS elasticsearch account with data found in Server-GalacticBnb already in-place. Make sure that you are running the server on a different port. Next run npm install or npm i in the client and then npm start.
